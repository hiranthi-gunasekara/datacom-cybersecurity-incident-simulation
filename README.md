Datacom Cybersecurity Job Simulation (Forage)

This repository contains my completed work for the Datacom Cybersecurity 
Job Simulation on Forage.  
The simulation focused on two main areas:

1. Threat & Vulnerability Identification
2. Cybersecurity Incident Investigation & Reporting

It is designed to demonstrate my ability to perform practical cyber risk 
analysis, threat modelling and incident response documentation.

Task 1 – Threat & Vulnerability Identification 

🔍 Key Assets, Threats & Vulnerabilities Identified

Assets Reviewed:
•	Customer data & PII  
•	Ecommerce web platform  
•	CRM (Salesforce) & ERP (SAP) environments  
•	POS systems across all retail stores  
•	Cloud-hosted application environments  
•	Third-party API integrations (logistics, payments, loyalty 
systems)

Threats Identified:
•	Credential compromise & unauthorized account access  
•	Malware / ransomware on POS or endpoint devices  
•	SQL injection / web application attacks  
•	Misconfigured cloud resources  
•	Weak vendor security controls  
•	Network sniffing & unencrypted traffic exposure

Vulnerabilities Identified
•	Absence of MFA on critical systems  
•	Outdated POS operating systems  
•	Weak password policies  
•	Excessive user privileges  
•	Insufficient network segmentation  
•	Lack of continuous monitoring on third-party integrations  

 🧮 5×5 Risk Matrix Summary

I used a structured likelihood × impact matrix to score each threat 
category.  
High-risk scenarios included:

•	Customer data breach via compromised credentials  
•	ERP / financial system compromises due to excess privileges  
•	Third-party system weaknesses leading to supply chain risk  
•	Web application exploitation (SQLi, XSS) targeting customer portal  

🛡️ Recommended Mitigations

•	Enforce strong access control, MFA and least privilege  
•	Implement network segmentation and Zero Trust architecture  
•	Improve logging, SIEM visibility, and alerting  
•	Strengthen cloud configuration governance  
•	Conduct vendor security assessments and establish SLAs  
•	Apply regular patching & vulnerability scanning

Task 2 – Cybersecurity Incident Investigation

📌 Incident Summary

The simulated incident involved suspicious login attempts and potential 
account misuse within the environment.

🧪 Investigation Steps Performed

•	Analysed login records, alerts, and user behaviour  
•	Identified indicators of compromise (IoCs)  
•	Correlated timeline of events to understand attacker activity  
•	Determined which systems and data were potentially affected  
•	Assessed whether lateral movement or privilege escalation occurred  

📝 Documentation Included in Report

•	Clear incident description and business impact  
•	Detailed timeline of events  
•	Identified IoCs (IP addresses, unusual access patterns, etc.)  
•	Root cause analysis  
	Containment actions, including access revocation  
•	Eradication recommendations (password resets, configuration fixes)  
•	Long-term prevention measures, such as improved IAM and monitoring  

 🧯 Recommended Security Improvements

•	Strengthen IAM and enforce MFA across user accounts  
•	Improve log visibility and SIEM correlation rules  
•	Introduce anomalous login detection policies  
•	Train staff on phishing and suspicious behaviour reporting  
•	Implement continuous monitoring and threat-hunting procedures

 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

•	Threat & vulnerability identification  
•	Risk assessment using a structured 5×5 matrix  
•	Security control selection & prioritisation  
•	Incident analysis & root cause determination  
•	Writing clear, professional security reports  
•	Applying best-practice frameworks and mitigation strategies
